window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pulitzer Prize, Fiction, 2007</b></p>America is a barren landscape of smoldering ashes, devoid of life except for those people still struggling to scratch out some type of existence. Amidst this destruction, a father and his young son walk, always toward the coast, but with no real understanding that circumstances will improve once they arrive. Still, they persevere, and their relationship comes to represent goodness in a world of utter devastation. <p>Bleak but brilliant, with glimmers of hope and humor, <i>The Road</i> is a stunning allegory and perhaps Cormac McCarthy's finest novel to date. This remarkable departure from his previous works has been hailed by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> as a \"novel of horrific beauty, where death is the only truth\".</p> <p>McCarthy, a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, is a past recipient of the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award. He is widely considered one of America's greatest writers.</p>";
