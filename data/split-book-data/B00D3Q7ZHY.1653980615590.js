In <i>The Road to Woodbury</i>, an innocent traveler named Lilly Caul wound up in the terrifying thrall of Phillip Blake's twisted, violent dictatorship within Woodbury's ever tightening barricades.&nbsp;</p> <p>And now, in <i>The Fall of the Governor</i>, the Governor's complex story continues in a tour de force of action and horror. Iconic characters from the comic book, including Rick, Michonne and Glenn, finally make their entrance onto this nightmarish stage, and fans of <i>The Walking Dead</i> will see these characters in a whole new light.&nbsp;</p>";
